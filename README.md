# all-the-good-things

All The Good Things is an event where people write notes to each other and submit them through Google Forms. This repository contains code used to generate the .tex and .pdf files for everyone's notes from the Google Form responses.

## "Features" for inputs

- Bold text by putting it between two asterisks on either side (`**bold text**`)
- You can insert math using standard LaTeX. For in-line math, put your math between one dollar sign on either side (`$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$`); if you want your math on its own line, then use two dollar signs on each side(`$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`)
